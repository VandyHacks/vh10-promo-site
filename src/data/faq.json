    "question": "What is a hackathon?",
    "answer": "A hackathon is an event where you collaborate with others to create a project from scratch. It’s less about the final product, but more about the teamwork, creativity, and problem-solving skills that are sparked in the process. There is no limit to what you can create, but there are special prizes for projects that fit specific criteria."
